            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Likewiſe Paul doeth nat accuſe one certayne kinde and ſorte of men, but without any exception he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmeth al men to be gylty of ſinne, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt excepted, before god, ſayinge theſe wordes, that all mennes mouthes may be ſtopt, and al the whole world gil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie before God.

<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:4450:56"/>
ſhulde knowe them ſelfe nedy of mercy. Alſo Paul ſayeth He that is proud and reioyſeth: let him be proud in the lorde. Theſe and ſuch other lyke ſentences ſet good men ſet before them, that they may learne to knowe theyr infyrmyties to be ſinne without doubte, and that they may feare the wrath of God, whiche is againſt ſinne, and ſo let repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance grow in vs. It is ſayde in the Geneſis concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the latter iudgement.

For the workes are a certayne outwarde iuſtice of the Lawe, and are acceptable in them which be reconcyled, but they deſerue nat remiſſion of ſinne, or acceptation to eternal life. Therfore he ſayd that Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ham by his workes is iuſtified, that is as much to ſay, as the workes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham are pronounced iuſte, the which is true in Abraham being iuſt and reconcy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led and beleuing.

Some men there be whiche do doubte whether God doethe paſſe or regarde mannes neceſſitie and cauſes, whether that eyther proſperitie or aduerſitie doeth chaunce and happen by fortune, withoute any prouiſion and gouernance of God, or nay.

                     <pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:4450:72"/>¶ Loue is the pryncipall and chifeſt of all vertuſe.

If we had the vertues whiche the lawe of god doth require, and were without ſyn then we might be ſayde well, to be iuſte for loue &amp; other vertues: but bycauſe of our wekeneſſe and gret infirmite is far from that parfection of the law, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng in loue as we ought to do, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the goſpel ſetteth forth an other iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice teaching vs not for our owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe but for ſome other thyng that is not in vs: that is for our mediatours ſake, the ſonne of god: to be reputed iuſt, but vnder a condition: that by feithe we do aſſure our ſelfe, that god is merciful to vs for his ſonne ſake.

                  <p>¶ They do lay for them this word and vocable (Rewarde), ſayinge. The lyfe euerlaſting is called a rewarde. Ergo,<note place="margin">The ſyxte obiection.</note> good workes do deſerue lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.

                  <p>¶ The which daungerous peryl our fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers were wel ware of. Therfore Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine and Bernarde agreinge to the Apoſtle his wrytyng, ſayde that frely for Chriſt ſake is giuen lyfe euerlaſting to him that beleueth, and as Paul forther more doth teſtyfy with theſe wordes.

Thys is no vncertayne gyfte, the Lorde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundinge that we do beleue, and that we ſhall receyue lyfe euerlaſtinge for Chriſt ſake alone, as Iohn the .vi. chap. This is the wyll of the father: that all men which beleueth in the ſon ſhal haue lyfe euerlaſting. This Fayth doeth nat conſiſt without repentance, but it doth conſyder and beholde both partes of the ſayinge of Chriſte, whiche is. I lyue, I

                  <p>¶ Wherfore natwithſtanding that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce is requyred at our hande, we maye nat thynke that the condicion of oure worthynes is to be admitted.</p>

As to the fyrſt parte called the Maior. I ſay that is true, if we ſpeake of iuſtice of the lawe. For the iuſtice of the lawe is obedience to the hole lawe.

diſciples and miniſters, with the name and moſt falſly vſurped power of Antechriſt him ſelfe: didde his grace, (naye god in him, for it paſſed mannes power) as it were in a moment of tyme to be compared to ſo great an act, ſwepe awaye and ſhake cleane forthe of hys realme and dominion.

I know a certayn cathedral church in Englande, of no ſmal rentes and poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſions, repleniſhed and adourned with al kinde of goodly ornamentes, lacking neyther popynge nor ſyngyng, a temple worthy to be (as it is) the ſeate of a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop, called ſaint Auguſtins of Briſtow in the which for the ſpace of .ix. mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thes after they had expreſſe commaundement by the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges maieſtie, which is in glory a man mighte haue ſene Poules ſteple ſtande vpon the hyghe aulter, as ſone as the byble in the church, or any part there of.

to ſuffer it to be in tht ſight of his people If there ſhulde be a commaundemente that the people (for ſatiſfaction and pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance, bicauſe they haue committed ydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry) ſhulde ſette vp on euery of theyr ſeates an ymage of this or that, with cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne candels before it, to knele downe before it at certayne tymes, to kiſſe and lycke it, to ſaye certayne prayers to it.

and grant it to the rych, nat that it ſhuld be ſet forth the more fruitfully by them, but for .ii. other cauſes whiche they do kepe cloſe within theyr owne boſomes to them ſelfe, that one is, knowing that the moſt part of the ryche ſort ar ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vppe with this worlde, and the care therof, that they paſſe nat for it (which maketh well for theyr purpoſe) that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe is, if any of the ryche do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the word thankfully, knowleging the benefites of God, yet they wyl be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed to profeſſe it openly, for daunger they ſhulde be entrapped with the loſſe both of theyr bodies and goodes.</p>
            <p>¶ Theſe be the practices of the prelates of Antechriſt hꝭ church to ſuppreſſe and put downe the worde of God, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than his kingdome myght floriſhe.
